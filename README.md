Project based on the DocuSign API.

When complete, this app uses the DocuSign IOS API in order to facilitate communication between professors and students. No more handing out syllabi, homework, or readings. Everything can be done from one feed that connects professors directly to students. The Docusign API has for purpose to generate templates of documents, allow students to easily fill out forms, and allow professors to keep track of the time each student spends on readings or homnework.
In order for this to be possible, this app's data is stored in Google's firebase, allowing multiple devices to access the same data when needed.
